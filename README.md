# D3-Javascript-Time-Series-vs-Date-Graph
<br> This Project is used to create a Date vs Time Series Graph in D3 JS
I used Python Flask as my backend tool and Jinja2 to Pass the data to HTML/CSS
Graph rendering is done in D3.js <br>
<br>This script helps python programmers or data analysts develop "date vs time series" projects. This application was developed in Javascript using D3 framework and data was through Jinja2 Engine from Python to frontend. The "data-time series graph" is also used to uncover insights from their data. More information can be found on Github or Plotly Forum.</br>
